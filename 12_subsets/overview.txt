These seem really complicated, but they're not too bad.
The main thing to remember is that you're either going to
1. start with a copy of the whole thing, if you're doing permutations, or
2. start with the first character/integer/whatever if you're doing subsets

and then you're going to make a copy of each permutation that you've already
made and change it with the next char/int in the sequence.
